## Introduction - Nitrous.io

We'll be using Nitrous.io as our main development environment this summer. Flatiron will be covering the cost of the 'pro version' for both students and teachers.

### What is Nitrous?

Nitrous is an Integrated Development Environment, or IDE. It's basically a computer that we can control through our web browser that gives us access to all of the tools we need as developers, including a text editor and terminal. This means that we can get started programming quickly from any operating system. 

### Is this the same as Codeacademy? 

No! Codeacademy uses a REPL, which stand for Read, Evaluate, Print, and Loop. It provides an interactive interface to try out code and test new languages, like Ruby! Nitrous, on the other hand, is a professional tool for software developers - you can build full applications there. 

### Using Nitrous

All code is just text, written in a text file. Your computer then interprets that text as instructions and executes. Nitrous, is made up of two main parts - a text editor, to write code, and a command line/terminal, to execute. Nitrous also includes a file browser so we can visually see the different files in our projects. 

On the first day of class, someone at Flatiron School's engineering team will create a "container" for you. Once it's created, you'll see it in your list of "shared containers." A container is just a computer that you can control from the cloud. The main section is our text editor, where we can write our code. It's a text editor just like Microsoft Word or Text Edit, but does some nice features for code like At the bottom of our window is our terminal/command line. This is how developers control their computer - we can create files, execute code, and navigate through our file structures right from here. To the right is a file browser - this is a quick visual way to see all of the files in our current directory.
