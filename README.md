## Introduction - Nitrous.io

We'll be using Nitrous.io as our main development environment this summer. Flatiron will be covering the cost of the 'pro version' for both students and teachers.

### What is Nitrous?

Nitrous is an Integrated Development Environment, or IDE. It's basically a computer that we can control through our web browser that gives us access to all of the tools we need as developers, including a text editor and terminal. This means that we can get started programming quickly from any computer with an internet connection. 

### Is this the same as Codeacademy? 

No! Codeacademy uses a REPL, which stand for Read, Evaluate, Print, and Loop. It provides an interactive interface to try out code and test new languages, like Ruby or Python. Nitrous, on the other hand, is a professional tool for software developers. It creates a virtual machine for you and gives you control of the development environment. You'll use it to build full applications. 

### Using Nitrous

On the first day of class, someone at Flatiron School's engineering team will create a "container" for you. Once it's created, you'll see it in your list of "shared containers." This container represents your virtual machine. Click on the container, then click "IDE" to launch your development environment.

The Nitrous IDE is made up of three parts - a text editor, file browser, and terminal/command line.

The main section is our text editor, where we can write our code. It's a text editor just like Microsoft Word or Text Edit, but does some nice features for code like syntax highlighting and closing parenthesis automatically.

 At the bottom of our window is our terminal/command line. This is how developers control their computer - we can create files, execute code, and navigate through our file structures right from here. 

 To the left is a file browser - this is a quick visual way to see all of the files in our current directory.

 All of this might look a little overwhelming at first, but soon you'll be navigating your environment like a pro!
